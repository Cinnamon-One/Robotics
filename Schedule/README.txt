What is the Schedule Folder:

- The schedule folder helps us organize what we have to do, in what order, and who does what. If you have any comments
or want to suggest anything, then use the Schedule Folder. 
- It's primary reason for existence is for communication and a deadline planner. 

REMEMBER TO NAME EVERY FILE YOU UPLOAD INTO THE SCHEDULE FOLER AS EITHER:
[date]
[author] [date]
[any_text] [date]

The Date Format is the Japanese Format:
Year/Month/Day
